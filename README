This was my very first game. It's a Tetris clone with a twist: the option to
make the game harder by adding an additional random block to every piece. Such a
simple change actually makes the game extremely hard; I've only ever seen
somebody get up to 31 lines.

This code demonstrates how to do many things in Java: for example, it creates a
GUI through raw code, without using any libraries or building applications. It
also demonstrates how to load music into your application and mess with it.

Unfortunately, the code also demonstrates how not to use a settings file for the
pieces, and how to share variables across threads. It wasn't my proudest moment,
but for a first game ever it was pretty good.
